# Simple OAuth2 Client

A simple OAuth2 client for WordPress. Support password grant tokens only.

Tested with [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/passport).

Inspired by [WP OAuth Server](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oauth2-provider/) and [Simple Single Sign On](https://wordpress.org/plugins/single-sign-on-client/) plugins.
